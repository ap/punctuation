NAME
	 punctuation - Forbid uses of punctuation variables


SYNOPSIS
	 no punctuation;

	 no punctuation 'anon';


DESCRIPTION
       Use of the "no punctuation" pragma in a package forbids
       all uses of punctuation variables such as "$"", "$!",
       "$^O", and so on in named subroutines defined in that
       package.

       "no punctuation 'anon'" forbids the use of punctuation
       variables in all anonymous subroutines in the program.

       "use punctuation" does nothing.

       EXPORT

       None by default.

PREREQUISITE
       Requires "B::Utils".  However, the version of "B::Utils"
       available on CPAN at this time of this writing (version
       0.02) has many bugs.  You may obtain a corrected copy of
       0.02 from "http://perl.plover.com/punctuation/" .

TODO
       Probably none of it works the way you wish it would, but
       as they say: If a thing's not worth doing at all, it's not
       worth doing well.
